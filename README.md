# Library
Collection of general scripts and utilities that could be used across multiple projects.

### Bit Flag Menu
Aimed to implement filter from Rhynoscript's GetObjects method (https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/#collapse-GetObjects).
Could be used to implement menus in CLI applications, et al.

### Timebooker
Small utility to help me keep track of time.
Task name; time spent on it; and any comments are written to file for later processing.
This file is meant to be deleted, and restarted, at arbritrary times; usually a work day.
